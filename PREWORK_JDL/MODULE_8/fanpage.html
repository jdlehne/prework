	<h2>Who is Devo?</h2>
		<p> Devo sprung out of Akron Ohio in the early 70's when two friends's formed a satirical music duo at Kent State University.  They chose the name "Devo" a tongue in cheek reference to the idea of humanity's "De-evoultion", the idea of the dumbing down of <em>then</em> modern civilization.</p>
		<p>Overall the band would see some14 members drop in, out, pass away to form what was once thought to be a "<em>Joke Band</em>" but in 1978 recieved it's first record contract at the urging of artists like David Bowie and Iggy Pop.  They're first studio album "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_We_Not_Men%3F_We_Are_Devo!" target="_blank">Q: Are We Not Men A: We are Devo!</a>" was produced by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno#1970s" target="_blank">Brian Eno</a> who also worked with Bowie, alng with many other bands including the Talking Heads, U2, Genesis and many more. </p>
		<p>With a career over <strong>forty plus</strong> years, they would see 14 members come and go and release 9 studio albums in addition ot playing thousands of shows, numerous television appearances and many spin-offs and music production jobs in modern television shows and  major motion pictures.</p>
